## Miscellany

*SpecificationPatternDotNet* targets the .NET Framework 4.5, which is only available on Windows Vista and later.

Nothing prevents you from reducing the library target to a version of the .NET Framework that runs on operating systems earlier than Windows Vista.

The library is not tied to any particular architecture, the code should execute on x86, x64 and ia64.

## Bugs/Feedback

If you encounter a scenario where code doesn't work as you expect, you're welcome to report a bug, initiate a pull request or send an email to `t AT speot DOT is`. The latter method is likely to elicit a response, but not guaranteed.

The above applies equally for feedback.
